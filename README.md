## Description ##
This program is developed to to fulfill the First Major Assignment of IF2123 Linear Algebra and Geometry course. For this task, we use Java programming language and this program is intended to do:
1. Calculating the linear system equations using gauss, gauss Jordan, inverse and cramer
2. Calculating the determinant of matrix using row reduction and cramer
3. Making matrix inverses
4. Solving interpolation, bicubic, and regression

## How to Run ##
1. Clone this repository
2. Go to your file explorer to where you saved this repository
3. Go to file `src` then open command prompt there
4. Type in `javac Main.java`
5. Then type in `java Main`
6. Our programm will hopefully run
